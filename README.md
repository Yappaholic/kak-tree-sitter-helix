# kak-tree-sitter-helix
Python scripts to generate [kak-tree-sitter](https://github.com/phaazon/kak-tree-sitter) grammars, queries and themes by relying on [Helix repository](https://github.com/helix-editor/helix).

## Motivation
`kak-tree-sitter` is an amazing tool that brings the power of [tree-sitter](https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/) to [Kakoune](http://kakoune.org).

We want to improve the end user experience by providing out-of-the-box precompiled grammars, queries and themes by relying on the work that was already done by `Helix` maintainers.


## Note
This repo is in a heavy work-in-progress.

The things will likely change a lot in the nearest future.
